## Introduction to BigFix

### What is BigFix?
BigFix (now part of HCL Technologies) is an endpoint management platform that provides real-time visibility and control over a wide variety of endpoints. It excels in software distribution, patch management, compliance, and inventory management across heterogeneous environments.

### Key Capabilities for Software Version Management
- **Real-time endpoint visibility**: View the exact software state of any Windows 11 machine in your environment
- **Precision targeting**: Target specific machines based on detailed criteria
- **Rapid deployment**: Deploy software updates and packages to thousands of endpoints simultaneously
- **Closed-loop verification**: Ensure software deployments have been successfully completed
- **Low network impact**: Optimized for efficient bandwidth usage across distributed environments
