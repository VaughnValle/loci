$\mathbb P (A)$
- the set of all subsets of A
- $|\mathbb P (A)|$ is always $2^n$ for $n$ elements $\in A$
	- cardinality of power set is always $2^n$

Example: $A=\set {0,1,2}$
$|\mathbb P (A)|=2^3=8$
$\mathbb P (A) = \set {\set{\phi}, \set{0},\set{1},\set{2},\set{0,1},\set{1,2},\set{0,2},\set{0,1,2}}$
