# Chapter 3: Describing Syntax and Semantics

_(Based on CSUY 3314 ProgLang pl12ch3.ppt) citeturn0file0_

### 1. Introduction to Syntax and Semantics

- **Syntax**:
    - Defines the structure or form of expressions, statements, and program units.
    - Specifies how symbols may be arranged (grammar of the language).
- **Semantics**:
    - Describes the meaning of those expressions and constructs.
    - Important for language users, implementers, and other designers.

### 2. Terminology and Formal Definitions

- **Basic Terms**:
    - **Sentence**: A string of characters over an alphabet.
    - **Language**: A set of sentences.
    - **Lexeme**: The smallest unit in the language (e.g., keywords like _sum_, _begin_).
    - **Token**: A category or class of lexemes (e.g., identifier).
- **Formal Devices**:
    - **Recognizers**: Programs that check whether a given string belongs to a language (e.g., syntax analysis in a compiler).
    - **Generators**: Devices or methods to generate sentences based on the language’s rules.

### 3. BNF, Context-Free Grammars, and EBNF

- **Context-Free Grammars (CFGs)**:
    - Introduced by Noam Chomsky.
    - Describe the syntax of natural and programming languages.
- **Backus-Naur Form (BNF)**:
    - A notation invented to describe Algol 58; equivalent to CFGs.
    - **Rules in BNF**:
        - Each rule has a left-hand side (nonterminal) and a right-hand side (a string of terminals and/or nonterminals).
        - Nonterminals are often enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<stmt>`).
        - A start symbol is designated to begin derivations.
- **Extended BNF (EBNF)**:
    - Enhances BNF with constructs for optional parts (`[ ]`), alternatives (using vertical bars), and repetitions (`{ }`).
    - Often uses modern notations like a colon instead of `→` and keywords like `opt` or `oneof`.

### 4. Derivations, Parse Trees, and Ambiguity

- **Derivations**:
    - A process of applying grammar rules starting from the start symbol until a sentence (all terminals) is produced.
    - **Leftmost and Rightmost Derivations**:
        - Leftmost: Always expand the leftmost nonterminal.
        - Rightmost: Expand the rightmost nonterminal.
- **Parse Trees**:
    - A visual hierarchical representation of a derivation showing the structure of a sentence.
- **Ambiguity**:
    - A grammar is ambiguous if a sentential form has more than one distinct parse tree.
    - Resolving ambiguity may involve restructuring the grammar to indicate operator precedence and associativity.

### 5. Attribute Grammars and Semantic Description

- **Attribute Grammars (AGs)**:
    - Extend CFGs by associating attributes with grammar symbols.
    - **Attributes**:
        - **Synthesized Attributes**: Computed from the attributes of the children in the parse tree.
        - **Inherited Attributes**: Passed from parent nodes or siblings.
    - Useful for specifying static semantics and performing semantic checks (e.g., type checking).

### 6. Approaches to Semantics

- **Operational Semantics**:
    - Defines meaning by describing the execution (state changes) on a machine (or a simulated machine).
    - Can be given at a natural (informal) or structural (formal) level.
- **Denotational Semantics**:
    - Maps programming constructs to mathematical objects using recursive functions.
    - Emphasizes the notion of program state as a mapping from variables to values.
- **Axiomatic Semantics**:
    - Based on logical assertions (preconditions, postconditions) that describe what must be true before and after execution.
    - Utilizes the concept of weakest preconditions and loop invariants to verify correctness.

### 7. Summary of Chapter 3

- BNF and CFGs provide a concise method for describing language syntax.
- Attribute grammars help integrate semantic rules into the syntax description.
- Three primary methods to describe semantics: operational, denotational, and axiomatic—each with its own advantages for language design, implementation, and program verification.

# Chapter 4: Lexical and Syntax Analysis

_(Based on CSUY 3314 S25 ProgLang pl12ch4.ppt) citeturn0file1_

### 1. Introduction to Language Processing

- Language processors must analyze source code regardless of the underlying implementation.
- The syntax of the source language is often described using BNF.

### 2. Lexical Analysis

- **Role**:
    - Acts as the front end of a compiler or interpreter.
    - Converts the input character stream into a stream of tokens.
- **Lexemes and Tokens**:
    - **Lexemes**: Groups of characters (e.g., identifiers, numbers, reserved words).
    - **Tokens**: Categories that lexemes belong to (e.g., IDENT, INT_CONSTANT).
- **Implementation Techniques**:
    - **Table-Driven Lexical Analyzers**: Generated from formal token specifications.
    - **Hand-Written Analyzers**: Based on state diagrams that define transitions between states.
- **Key Utility Functions**:
    - **getChar**: Reads the next character and classifies it.
    - **addChar**: Accumulates characters into the current lexeme.
    - **lookup**: Checks if a lexeme is a reserved word.
- **Efficiency**:
    - Simplification via combining transitions using character classes (e.g., all letters or digits).

### 3. The Parsing Problem

- **Goals of Parsing**:
    - Identify and report syntax errors.
    - Construct a parse tree (or a derivation trace) representing the structure of the source code.
- **Two Main Parsing Techniques**:
    - **Top-Down Parsing**:
        - Begins at the start symbol and works toward the leaves.
        - Implements leftmost derivation.
        - Common methods: Recursive descent and LL parsing.
    - **Bottom-Up Parsing**:
        - Begins with the input tokens and works upward to form the start symbol.
        - Typically uses shift-reduce strategies.
        - Well-known in the LR family of parsers.

### 4. Top-Down Parsing

- **Recursive-Descent Parsing**:
    - A separate subroutine is written for each nonterminal in the grammar.
    - Straightforward when using EBNF to reduce the number of nonterminals.
    - **Example Structure**:
        - An `expr()` function that calls `term()` and then loops while the next token is a plus or minus operator.
    - **Error Handling**:
        - The basic routines may not detect errors unless explicitly programmed.
- **Grammar Issues**:
    - **Left Recursion**:
        - Must be eliminated (by rewriting the grammar) because top-down parsers cannot handle left-recursive rules.
    - **Left Factoring**:
        - Used when the parser cannot decide among alternatives with one-token lookahead.
- **Pairwise Disjointness**:
    - For a nonterminal with multiple alternatives, the FIRST sets of the alternatives must be disjoint.

### 5. Bottom-Up Parsing

- **Shift-Reduce Parsing**:
    - **Shift**: Pushes the next token onto the parse stack.
    - **Reduce**: Replaces a sequence of tokens (handle) with a nonterminal based on a grammar rule.
- **LR Parsing**:
    - Uses a finite state machine with two tables:
        - **ACTION Table**: Dictates whether to shift, reduce, accept, or signal an error.
        - **GOTO Table**: Indicates which state to transition to after a reduction.
    - **Parser Configuration**:
        - The parser maintains a stack that tracks both symbols and state information.
    - **Advantages**:
        - Can handle a larger class of grammars than LL parsers.
        - Offers early syntax error detection.
- **Parser Generation Tools**:
    - Tools like yacc or bison can automatically generate the LR parsing tables from a given grammar.

### 6. Summary of Chapter 4

- **Lexical Analysis**:
    - Tokenizes the input stream and simplifies the job for the parser.
- **Syntax Analysis**:
    - Two main approaches: Top-down (recursive descent/LL) and bottom-up (shift-reduce/LR).
- **Parsing Challenges**:
    - Left recursion and non-disjoint alternatives require careful grammar design (e.g., elimination or left factoring).
- **LR Parsers**:
    - Though more complex to build, they are powerful and widely used in practical compiler design.

## Final Overview

These chapters provide the theoretical foundations for both describing and implementing programming languages:

- **Chapter 3** focuses on _what_ a language means by detailing syntax (using formal grammars like BNF/EBNF) and semantics (via operational, denotational, and axiomatic approaches). It also introduces attribute grammars as a method to integrate semantic rules into the syntactic structure.
- **Chapter 4** shifts attention to _how_ a language is processed. It covers the practical aspects of converting source code into a structured form through lexical analysis and parsing. The distinctions between top-down and bottom-up approaches help highlight different strategies and challenges in building language processors.

# Chapter 5: Names, Bindings, and Scopes

_(Based on CSUY 3314 S25 ProgLang pl12ch5.ppt) citeturn1file0_

### 1. Introduction

- **Imperative Languages and the von Neumann Model**:
    - Languages often mirror the architecture of physical computers (memory and processor).
    - Variables are central as they represent memory cells, so their design must address issues such as scope, lifetime, type checking, initialization, and compatibility.

### 2. Names

- **Design Issues**:
    - **Case Sensitivity**:
        - Some languages (e.g., C, C++, Java) are case sensitive, while others are not.
        - Mixed-case predefined names (like Java’s exceptions) can add complexity.
    - **Length and Connotation**:
        - Names should be long enough to be meaningful.
        - Some languages impose limits (e.g., C99 considers only the first 63 characters significant).
    - **Special Characters**:
        - Certain languages use prefixes to denote types (e.g., PHP variables begin with `$`, Ruby uses `@` for instance variables).
    - **Reserved vs. Keywords**:
        - Keywords have special meaning in specific contexts, whereas reserved words cannot be used as user-defined names.
        - Too many reserved words can lead to naming collisions.

### 3. Variables

- **Concept**:
    - A variable is an abstraction for a memory cell.
- **Attributes (Sextuple)**:
    - **Name**: Identifier (may not always be present).
    - **Address**: The memory location; note that a variable may reside at different addresses during execution.
    - **Value**: Contents of the memory cell.
        - **L-value**: Refers to the address.
        - **R-value**: Refers to the actual data stored.
    - **Type**: Determines the set of allowable operations and value ranges; also influences precision in cases such as floating point numbers.
    - **Lifetime**: Duration during which the variable is bound to a memory cell.
    - **Scope**: The part of the program where the variable is visible.
- **Aliases**:
    - Occur when different names refer to the same memory location (e.g., via pointers or reference variables).
    - They can make the program harder to read.

### 4. The Concept of Binding

- **Definition**:
    - Binding is the association between an entity (e.g., a variable) and its attributes (like type or value).
- **Binding Time**:
    - **Language Design Time**: Binding operators to operations.
    - **Language Implementation Time**: Assigning representations (e.g., for floating-point types).
    - **Compile Time**: E.g., binding a variable to a type in C or Java.
    - **Load Time**: E.g., binding static variables to memory cells in C/C++.
    - **Runtime**: E.g., binding nonstatic local variables to memory cells during execution.
- **Static vs. Dynamic Binding**:
    - **Static Binding**: Occurs before runtime and remains constant during execution.
    - **Dynamic Binding**: Occurs during program execution and may change.

### 5. Type Binding and Declarations

- **Type Binding**:
    - Can be specified explicitly (using a declaration statement) or implicitly (by default conventions or type inferencing).
- **Explicit Declarations**:
    - Required in languages like C, C++, and Java.
- **Implicit Declarations and Type Inferencing**:
    - Languages like Perl, Ruby, JavaScript, and modern versions of C# (using `var`) determine types from context.
    - **Advantages**: Simplicity and writability.
    - **Disadvantages**: Potential loss of early error detection.
- **Dynamic Type Binding**:
    - Found in languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
    - Offers flexibility but incurs runtime overhead and may delay type error detection.

### 6. Storage Bindings and Variable Lifetime

- **Storage Binding**:
    - **Allocation**: Acquiring a memory cell.
    - **Deallocation**: Releasing the memory cell back to a pool.
- **Categories by Lifetime**:
    - **Static Variables**:
        - Bound before execution begins and persist throughout the program.
        - Offer efficient direct addressing but are inflexible (e.g., no recursion support).
    - **Stack-Dynamic Variables**:
        - Allocated when their declarations are executed (e.g., local variables in C/Java methods).
        - Allow recursion, but involve allocation overhead and may require indirect addressing.
    - **Explicit Heap-Dynamic Variables**:
        - Managed via explicit directives (e.g., `new` and `delete` in C++).
        - Provide dynamic storage management with risks of inefficiency and errors.
    - **Implicit Heap-Dynamic Variables**:
        - Managed automatically via assignment (common in languages like Perl, JavaScript, and PHP).
        - Highly flexible but can lead to inefficiencies and reduced error checking.

### 7. Scope

- **Definition**:
    - Scope is the region of the program where a variable is visible.
- **Static (Lexical) Scope**:
    - Determined by the program’s textual layout.
    - The declaration is found by searching the local scope first and then the enclosing scopes (static ancestors).
    - Variables in nested subprograms are resolved based on their closest enclosing declaration.
- **Dynamic Scope**:
    - Based on the calling sequence during execution, not on the textual structure.
    - While easier for temporary convenience, it makes static type checking and readability more difficult.
- **Blocks and Let Constructs**:
    - **Blocks**:
        - Allow nested scopes (e.g., in C, a variable declared within a block can hide one in an outer block).
        - Some languages (Java, C#) limit this practice to avoid errors.
    - **Let Constructs**:
        - Common in functional languages, bind names to values locally (as seen in Scheme, ML, F#).

### 8. Declaration Order and Global Scope

- **Declaration Order**:
    - Some languages (C99, C++, Java) allow declarations anywhere within a block.
    - However, a variable must be declared before use, even if its scope covers the entire block.
- **Global Scope**:
    - Variables declared outside any function.
    - In languages like C/C++, PHP, and Python, global variables are accessible throughout the file (with language-specific rules for accessing or modifying them).

### 9. Referencing Environments

- **Definition**:
    - The collection of all names visible at a given point in the program.
- **Static-Scoped Languages**:
    - The environment includes local variables plus those in all enclosing scopes.
- **Dynamic-Scoped Languages**:
    - The environment includes the local variables along with variables from all active subprograms in the call chain.

### 10. Named Constants

- **Purpose**:
    - Improve readability and modifiability by giving descriptive names to fixed values.
- **Binding of Constants**:
    - Can be bound statically (manifest constants in C/C++ or compile-time constants in Java) or dynamically (e.g., readonly constants in C#).
- **Benefits**:
    - They help parameterize programs and make future changes easier.

### 11. Summary

- **Names**: Involve design decisions such as case sensitivity, length, special characters, and the use of reserved words.
- **Variables**: Characterized by a set of attributes (name, address, value, type, lifetime, scope) and may involve aliasing issues.
- **Binding**: Refers to the association of variables (and other entities) with their attributes, and can occur at various times from compile time to runtime.
- **Scope and Lifetime**:
    - Scope determines where a variable is visible, and lifetime defines how long a variable remains bound to a memory cell.
    - Static scoping (based on program text) contrasts with dynamic scoping (based on call history).
- **Referencing Environments and Named Constants**:
    - The referencing environment collects all accessible names at a point in the program.
    - Named constants enhance program clarity and are bound either at compile time or dynamically.
