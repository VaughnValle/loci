- stands for additive increase multiplicative decrease
- senders increase sending rate until they experience loss, then decrease sending rate on loss event
- additive increase
	- increase rate by 1 max segment size every RTT until loss
	- 1 message at a time, 2 messages at a time
- multiplicative decrease
	- decrease sending rate in half at each loss event
- +1 increase, $\cdot 1/2$ decrease
- Loss can be indicated when [[ACK]] is stuck on a number, which means server never got the packet at that sequence number, so packet at that sequence number needs to be retransmitted to move on
- If we get triple duplicate [[ACK]]
	- cut sending rate by half (TCP Reno)
- If we get loss by timeout
	- reset segment size to 1 (TCP Tahoe)
- Congestion Window, `cwnd`
	- dynamically adjust based on response from observed congestion
- TCP Slow Start
	- initially `cwnd=1` MSS
	- double `cwnd` every RTT
	- increment for every [[ACK]] received
	- `sshthresh=8` initially
	- on loss event, `sshthresh=1/2 * cwnd`, then increase linearly
