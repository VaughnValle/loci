By definition $f: Aâ†’B$ is a function if $\forall a \in A$, $\exists !b\in B$ such that $f(a) = b$
	mapping each element in $A$ to exactly one element in $B$
- recall the [[vertical line test]]
- mapping domain to codomain

## Components
- image
	- if $f(1)=B$, then $B$ is the image of 1 under $f$
- preimage
	- 1 is the preimage of $B$ under $f$
- range
	- all values $\in B$ that were mapped from domain to co-domain
