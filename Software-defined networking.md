- centralize the place where we make routing decisions to minimize mistakes
- opposite of [[destination-based forwarding]]
- using a remote controller as programming routers
- OpenFlow API
	- protocol to communicate with controller
- interfaces used to allow operability between different softwares, OSes, and hardware
- allows for load balancing
	- to distribute traffic along two different paths
- controller-switch messages
	- features
	- configure
	- modify-state
	- packet-out
### Disadvantage
- single point of failure
- security
- DDOS attacks more effective 
- inter-domain routing
