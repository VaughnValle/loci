## 4. Assessment Overview

Between November 22, 2023, and December 5, 2023, Near-Earth Broadcast Network (NBN) engaged [Your Company Name/Assessor Name] to conduct a security assessment. The primary objective was to evaluate the security posture of NBN's designated IT infrastructure against current industry best practices. This engagement included an internal network penetration test. All testing activities were based on established methodologies, including the NIST SP 800-115 Technical Guide to Information Security Testing and Assessment, the OWASP Testing Guide (v4), and customized testing frameworks developed by [Your Company Name/Assessor Name].

The penetration testing activities followed a structured approach:

* **Planning:** Defining customer goals, objectives, and establishing the rules of engagement.
* **Discovery:** Performing reconnaissance, scanning, and enumeration to identify potential vulnerabilities, system weaknesses, and exploitable entry points.
* **Attack & Exploitation:** Verifying potential vulnerabilities through controlled exploitation and performing further discovery based on newly acquired access or information.
* **Reporting:** Documenting all identified vulnerabilities, successful exploits, attempted but failed exploits, and observed strengths and weaknesses in the client's security posture.

## 5. Finding Severity Ratings

The severity of each identified vulnerability is rated based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.0. The following table defines the severity levels used throughout this report:

| Severity      | CVSS v3 Score Range | Definition                                                                                                                               |
| :------------ | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Critical** | 9.0 - 10.0          | Exploitation is generally straightforward and typically results in system-level compromise or significant data exposure. Immediate action is required. |
| **High** | 7.0 - 8.9           | Exploitation may be more complex but could lead to elevated privileges, significant data loss, or service downtime. Prompt remediation is advised. |
| **Medium** | 4.0 - 6.9           | Vulnerabilities exist that could be exploited, potentially requiring specific conditions or user interaction (e.g., social engineering). Plan remediation after addressing higher-priority issues. |
| **Low** | 0.1 - 3.9           | Vulnerabilities are typically non-exploitable or have minimal impact but addressing them would reduce the overall attack surface. Remediate during the next scheduled maintenance window. |
| **Informational** | N/A             | No direct vulnerability is present. This category is used for observations, best practice recommendations, or noting strong security controls. |

### Risk Factors

The overall risk associated with a vulnerability is determined by considering two primary factors:

* **Likelihood:** This measures the probability of a vulnerability being successfully exploited. It is assessed based on factors such as the ease of attack, availability of exploit tools, required attacker skill level, and specific characteristics of the target environment.
* **Impact:** This measures the potential consequences if a vulnerability is successfully exploited. It considers effects on confidentiality (data breaches), integrity (unauthorized data modification), and availability (system downtime) of NBN's systems and data, as well as potential reputational damage and financial losses.

## 7. Executive Summary

[Your Company Name/Assessor Name] performed an internal penetration test of the Near-Earth Broadcast Network (NBN) IT infrastructure between November 22, 2023, and December 5, 2023. The assessment aimed to identify and exploit vulnerabilities that could be leveraged by an attacker with internal network access. The engagement followed industry-standard methodologies, including NIST SP 800-115 and the OWASP Testing Guide.

### Key Findings Summary

The assessment identified several vulnerabilities, ranging from Critical to Moderate severity, indicating significant risks to NBN's internal systems and data.

* **Critical Vulnerability:** A command line injection vulnerability (IPT-001) was discovered, allowing for arbitrary command execution on a key server. This presents a direct path to system compromise.
* **High Vulnerability:** A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (IPT-002) was identified in the customer portal, which could lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to user accounts.
* **Medium/Moderate Vulnerabilities:** Issues including insecure cookie management (IPT-003), information leakage via a customer list (IPT-004), and directory navigation capabilities (IPT-005) were also found. While not as immediately damaging as the critical and high findings, these vulnerabilities contribute to the overall risk profile and could be chained together or used to facilitate more significant attacks.

### Overall Security Posture

The findings indicate that NBN's internal network, specifically the assessed components, harbors critical security weaknesses. The presence of a command injection vulnerability, coupled with other exploitable flaws, suggests that an attacker with initial access to the internal network could potentially escalate privileges, compromise sensitive data, and disrupt operations. The development builds of the server and client images appear to lack sufficient input validation, secure coding practices, and robust access controls.

### Strategic Recommendations

NBN should prioritize the remediation of the identified vulnerabilities, starting with the Critical and High severity findings. A defense-in-depth strategy should be reinforced, focusing on:

1.  **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDLC):** Implementing secure coding training for developers, performing regular code reviews, and integrating security testing throughout the development process.
2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Rigorously validating and sanitizing all user-supplied input to prevent injection-style attacks (e.g., command injection, XSS, directory traversal).
3.  **Access Control Hardening:** Reviewing and strengthening access controls on sensitive files, directories, and functionalities.
4.  **Security Configuration Management:** Ensuring systems are configured securely, with unnecessary services disabled and secure defaults applied.
5.  **Regular Vulnerability Management:** Establishing a continuous vulnerability assessment and remediation program.

Addressing these areas will significantly improve NBN's resilience against internal threats. Detailed technical recommendations for each finding are provided later in this report.

## 9. Technical Findings

This section provides detailed information for each vulnerability identified during the assessment.

### Finding IPT-001: Command Line Injection Vulnerability

* **Severity:** Critical (CVSS Score: Example 9.8 - Actual score would depend on detailed metrics)
* **Description:** A command injection vulnerability was identified in the `index.php` file of the web application. By manipulating user-supplied input, it was possible to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands on the underlying server.
* **Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** High. The vulnerability is easily exploitable through crafted input to the web application, requiring minimal technical skill once identified.
    * **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands with the privileges of the webserver process. This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive system files, data exfiltration, installation of malware, and potentially full system compromise.
* **Affected System(s):** Web Application hosted on NBN Server (6573FinalServer.ova).
* **Tools Used:** Manual testing, command-line utilities, web proxy (e.g., Burp Suite/OWASP ZAP).
* **References:** OWASP Top 10: A03:2021-Injection, CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection').
* **Evidence:**
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 1: Command line injection payload targeting index.php, demonstrating execution of a benign OS command like `id` or `whoami`.)*
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 2: Output of an injected command (e.g., `route`) being written to or displayed via the `customer.list` file, indicating successful command execution and output redirection.)*
* **Remediation:**
    1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side input validation to ensure that user-supplied data conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters or command sequences. Use allow-lists for acceptable input rather than deny-lists.
    2.  **Parameterized Queries/Avoid Direct Command Execution:** Whenever possible, avoid constructing OS commands by concatenating user-supplied input directly. Utilize built-in functions or libraries that handle command execution more securely, or use alternative methods to achieve the desired functionality without direct OS command calls.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the webserver process runs with the minimum privileges necessary for its operation. This can limit the impact of a successful command injection.
    4.  **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on preventing injection vulnerabilities. Conduct regular code reviews.

### Finding IPT-002: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Customer Portal

* **Severity:** High (CVSS Score: Example 8.8)
* **Description:** A reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified on the customer portal, specifically within the `employee.php` page. The `name` attribute/parameter was found to be vulnerable, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.
* **Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** High. The vulnerability is exploitable by tricking a user into clicking a specially crafted link or submitting a malicious form.
    * **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation could lead to session hijacking (stealing user cookies), defacement of the web page, redirection to malicious websites, or execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the victim user within the application. This could compromise user accounts and sensitive information.
* **Affected System(s):** Customer Portal web application (employee.php) on NBN Server.
* **Tools Used:** OWASP ZAP, manual browser testing, web proxy.
* **References:** OWASP Top 10: A03:2021-Injection (XSS is a form of injection), CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
* **Evidence:**
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 3: A simple XSS payload (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`) injected into the 'name' parameter of employee.php, resulting in the execution of the script in the user's browser.)*
* **Remediation:**
    1.  **Contextual Output Encoding:** Implement robust output encoding for all user-supplied data before it is rendered on a web page. The type of encoding should be specific to the context where the data is being placed (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML body, JavaScript encoding for script blocks, URL encoding for URL parameters).
    2.  **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs to ensure they conform to expected patterns and lengths, rejecting any input that appears malicious.
    3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth measure. CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.
    4.  **HttpOnly and Secure Flags for Cookies:** While not a direct XSS prevention, ensure session cookies have the `HttpOnly` flag to prevent client-side scripts from accessing them, and the `Secure` flag to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.

---

### Finding IPT-003: Insecure Cookie Management

* **Severity:** Medium (CVSS Score: Example 6.5)
* **Description:** The web application was found to handle session cookies insecurely. Specifically, cookies may lack appropriate security attributes such as `Secure` and `HttpOnly`.
* **Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate. Exploitation often requires an attacker to be in a position to intercept network traffic (for missing `Secure` flag) or the presence of an XSS vulnerability (for missing `HttpOnly` flag).
    * **Impact:** High. If the `Secure` flag is missing, cookies can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP, making them vulnerable to interception. If the `HttpOnly` flag is missing, cookies can be accessed by client-side scripts, facilitating session hijacking if an XSS vulnerability is also present. This compromises user privacy and can lead to unauthorized account access.
* **Affected System(s):** Web applications on NBN Server.
* **Tools Used:** Manual browser inspection (developer tools), automated web vulnerability scanners.
* **References:** OWASP A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration, CWE-614: Sensitive Cookie in HTTPS Session Without 'Secure' Attribute, CWE-1004: Sensitive Cookie Without 'HttpOnly' Flag.
* **Evidence:**
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 4: Browser developer tools showing a session cookie without the 'Secure' and/or 'HttpOnly' flags set, potentially after manipulating a cookie to gain unauthorized data access as implied by the original report's figure caption.)*
* **Remediation:**
    1.  **Set Secure Flag:** Ensure that all session cookies, and any cookies transmitting sensitive information, have the `Secure` flag set. This will prevent the browser from sending the cookie over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
    2.  **Set HttpOnly Flag:** Ensure that all session cookies have the `HttpOnly` flag set. This will prevent client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of session theft through XSS attacks.
    3.  **Session Management Best Practices:** Implement secure session management practices, including using strong, randomly generated session tokens, session timeouts, and proper session termination upon logout.
    4.  **Security Awareness Training:** Educate development and IT teams on secure coding practices and the importance of secure cookie management. *(Note: The original report's recommendation to "Disable WDigest via GPO" for IPT-003 seems misplaced for "Insecure Cookie Management" and more relevant to credential dumping on Windows systems. The remediation here is focused on cookie security.)*

---

### Finding IPT-004: Information Leakage through Customer List

* **Severity:** Moderate (CVSS Score: Example 5.3)
* **Description:** The application was found to leak sensitive customer information through a `customer.list` file. This leakage appeared to be accessible or exacerbated by the command line injection vulnerability (IPT-001), allowing an attacker to exfiltrate or view this list.
* **Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate. Access to this information might depend on exploiting another vulnerability (like command injection) or weak access controls on the file itself.
    * **Impact:** Moderate. The exposure of a customer list can lead to privacy violations, reputational damage, and could be used for social engineering or targeted attacks against customers. Financial loss could occur if the information is used for fraudulent purposes.
* **Affected System(s):** Web Application on NBN Server, specifically related to the `customer.list` file and the `customer.php` page.
* **Tools Used:** Manual testing, command-line utilities (leveraging IPT-001).
* **References:** OWASP A01:2021-Broken Access Control, CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor.
* **Evidence:**
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 5: Output showing contents of `customer.list` obtained via command injection or by accessing `customer.php` with manipulated parameters, demonstrating unauthorized access to customer data.)*
* **Remediation:**
    1.  **Review and Enhance Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls on the `customer.list` file and any scripts or application functions that access it (e.g., `customer.php`). Ensure that only authorized users or processes have the necessary permissions.
    2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the web server process and application components only have read/write access to files and directories that are absolutely necessary for their function.
    3.  **Data Minimization:** Only store and provide access to customer information that is essential for the application's functionality.
    4.  **Input Validation (for accessing scripts):** If `customer.php` is used to display this data, ensure all input parameters are strictly validated to prevent unauthorized data retrieval.
    5.  **Security Policy Review:** Conduct a review of security policies related to data handling and access control to ensure they align with best practices for preventing information leakage.

---

### Finding IPT-005: Directory Navigation through Customer Portal

* **Severity:** Moderate (CVSS Score: Example 5.3)
* **Description:** A directory traversal (also known as path traversal) vulnerability was identified in the `/internal/customer.php` page. By manipulating the `list` attribute/parameter, it was possible to navigate outside of the intended web root directory and access arbitrary files and directories on the server's file system.
* **Risk:**
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate. Exploitation requires an attacker to identify the vulnerable parameter and craft input to traverse the directory structure.
    * **Impact:** Moderate. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized read access to sensitive files, such as configuration files, source code, or system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`). This information can be used to further compromise the system or gather intelligence for other attacks.
* **Affected System(s):** Customer Portal web application (`/internal/customer.php`) on NBN Server.
* **Tools Used:** Manual review, web browser, command-line utilities (e.g., `curl`).
* **References:** OWASP A01:2021-Broken Access Control, CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal').
* **Evidence:**
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 6 (if applicable, though original report jumps to Fig 7): Example of a directory traversal payload in the 'list' parameter.)*
    * `<screenshot>` *(Caption: Figure 7: Output showing the content of `/etc/passwd` (or another sensitive system file) accessed by manipulating the `list` parameter in `customer.php` with a payload like `../../../../etc/passwd`.)*
* **Remediation:**
    1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strong server-side validation of all user-supplied input used in file paths. Ensure that the input does not contain directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..`, `/`).
    2.  **Use Indirect References:** Instead of passing direct file paths in parameters, use indirect references (e.g., an ID mapped to a legitimate file path on the server-side) that cannot be manipulated by the user to access unintended files.
    3.  **Canonicalize Paths:** Before using any user-supplied path, canonicalize it (i.e., resolve it to its absolute and simplest form) and verify that it still falls within the intended base directory.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the web server process with the minimum necessary file system permissions. This can limit the scope of files an attacker can access even if a directory traversal vulnerability is exploited.
    5.  **Regular Security Patching:** Ensure the web server and associated software are updated regularly to address known vulnerabilities, although this specific issue is likely an application-level flaw.

## 10. Conclusion

The internal penetration test conducted on the Near-Earth Broadcast Network's (NBN) specified IT infrastructure revealed several critical and high-impact vulnerabilities. The presence of a command line injection vulnerability (IPT-001) and a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw (IPT-002), along with medium and moderate severity issues like insecure cookie management, information leakage, and directory traversal, indicates significant security weaknesses.

These vulnerabilities, if exploited by a malicious actor with internal network access, could lead to unauthorized system access, data compromise, session hijacking, and exposure of sensitive system and customer information. The findings underscore the need for immediate remediation efforts and a more robust approach to secure software development, input validation, and access control within NBN's environment.

Addressing the identified issues and implementing the recommended security enhancements will be crucial in strengthening NBN's security posture and mitigating the risk of a successful cyber-attack.
