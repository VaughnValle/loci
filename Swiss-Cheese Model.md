The Swiss cheese model is ==a metaphor that illustrates how multiple layers of defense can prevent errors from causing adverse events==.

How it works
- The model depicts slices of Swiss cheese stacked on top of each other. 
- Each slice represents a layer of defense in a system. 
- Holes in the cheese slices represent vulnerabilities in the system that could allow errors to pass through. 
- For adverse events to occur, multiple holes must align.
