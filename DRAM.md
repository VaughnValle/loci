- dynamic [[RAM]]
	- it is dynamic (active) from the fact that it constantly needs to be refreshed to keep data intact
	- Why? Because it uses capacitors/transistors to store memory
		- and recall that capacitors lose charge over time because of low energy density
			- meaning that they need to be constantly refreshed to restore them to their original charge
	- This is how DRAM keeps data intact, by constantly changing the states of capacitors through memory refreshes via electricity to store data
