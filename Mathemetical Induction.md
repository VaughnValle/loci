- is a technique used to prove $P(x)$ is true for all $x \in \mathbb{Z^+}$ by using the ladder analogy
### Components
1. Basis Step
	- verify that base case is true
	- could be $P(0)$ or $P(x)$
	- I can get to the first step!
2. Inductive Step
	- verify that if $P(k)$ is true, then $P(k+1)$ is also true $\forall k \in \mathbb {Z^+}$
	- I can get to any step!
	- Parts:
		- Inductive hypothesis: $P(k)$ is true
		- Show that $P(k)\implies P(k+1)$
- $\therefore P(k)$ is true $\forall k \in \mathbb {Z^+}$
