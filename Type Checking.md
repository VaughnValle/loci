- ensuring that operands and operator are of [[compatible types]]
- type error
- type casting
	- loss of data from `double` to `int`


## Strong Typing
- Rust

## Name Type Equivalence
- when copying from record to record, is it
	- sufficient that they have the same structure?
	- or do they have to be the same type
- if the struct is a date and copy from date-> date it's okay
	- but time -> date, nah


### In contrast...

## Structure Type Equivalence
- harder but more flexible for copying from record to record
