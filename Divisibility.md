## Definition
if $n$ and $d$ are $\mathbb Z$, $n$ is divisible by $d$ means:
1. $n=dk$, $k\epsilon \mathbb Z$, and $d\ne 0$

$d\mid n$ means "$d$ divides $n$", $\exists k\epsilon \mathbb Z$ such that $n=dk$
$d\nmid n$ means "$d$ does not divide $n$", $\nexists k\epsilon \mathbb Z$ such that $n=dk$


### Example 1
Is $9$ divisible by $4$?
1. No because $\nexists k\epsilon \mathbb Z$ such that $9=4k$
2. $k$ can only be $\mathbb Q$, which is not allowed for [[Divisibility]]

Is $0$ divisible by $10$?
1. Yes because 0 exists
2. $\exists k\epsilon \mathbb Z$ such that $0=10k$
3. $k=0$
Is $10$ divisible by $0$?
1. No because $\nexists k\epsilon \mathbb Z$ such that $10=0k$
	1. Note that term $0k$ is always $0$
